## 3. Module 3: Control Statements

### 3.1 Theory
1. Decision Making: `if`, `else`, `else-if`, `switch` statements.
2. Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops.
3. Loop Control: `break`, `continue`.

### 3.2 Practice

---

## 7. Module 7: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### 7.1 Theory
1. Inheritance: Superclass and Subclass.
2. Polymorphism: Method Overriding.
3. Abstraction: Abstract classes and Interfaces.
4. Encapsulation: Using Getter and Setter methods.

### 7.2 Practice
1. Create a class that inherits from another class and overrides a method.
2. Create an interface and implement it in a class.

---

## 8. Module 8: Exception Handling

### 8.1 Theory
1. What is an Exception, and why do exceptions occur?
2. `try-catch` block for handling exceptions.
3. Creating custom exceptions in Java.
4. The `throw` and `throws` keywords.

### 8.2 Practice
1. Create a program that handles an `ArithmeticException` while dividing by zero.
2. Create a custom exception to check for invalid input.

---

## 9. Module 9: File Handling

### 9.1 Theory
1. File Input/Output: `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, `FileReader`.
2. File Checking and Handling.

### 9.2 Practice
1. Create a program that writes text to a file and then reads from it.
2. Write a program to check if a file exists and print its content.

---

## 10. Module 10: Collection Framework

### 10.1 Theory
1. Lists: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` (Features, operations).
2. Sets: `HashSet`, `TreeSet` (No duplicates, sorting).
3. Maps: `HashMap`, `TreeMap` (Key-value pairs, access elements).

### 10.2 Practice
1. Create an `ArrayList`, add elements to it, and print them.
2. Create a `HashSet`, add elements to it, and print them without duplicates.

---

## 11. Module 11: GUI (Graphical User Interface)

### 11.1 Theory
1. Introduction to Java Swing: `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`.
2. Layout Managers: `FlowLayout`, `BorderLayout`.

### 11.2 Practice
1. Create a `JFrame` and add a `JButton` to it.
2. Use a `JTextField` to accept input from the user and display it.
